  <h1 align="Center">Bixby Earthquake Insights Sample Capsule</h1>
</p>

## Overview
This capsule allows users to search for earthquakes that occurred globally based on date-time, location, and minimum, maximum or approximate magnitude. This capsule demonstrates a sample implementation of Bixby’s DateTime and Geo libraries and is the companion to the [Mastering DateTime and Geo Libraries](https://bixby.developer.samsung.com/newsroom/en-us/When-and-Where-Mastering-DateTime-and-Geo-Libraries) article.


## How to get started
* Download and install the Bixby Studio IDE from the Bixby Developer Center.
* Download this capsule (zip is the easiest way) from GitHub. Unzip in your directory of choice.
* Open the Capsule in Bixby Developer Studio.
* Open the simulator and give it a try!

## How to try
```
Find earthquakes near me
What earthquakes happened in Oakland in the last 3 months
Show earthquakes in San Jose in 2017 with magnitude between 2.5 and 7.0
```

## How to customize
* This capsule shows an example implementation of the DateTime and Geo libraries, including best practices for modeling, Javascript implementation, and training. It can be used as a reference for capsules which utilize either of these libraries.
* Change the capsule id to reflect your organization and your content. The capsule id is defined in the `capsule.bxb` file
